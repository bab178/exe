                        <h4>Step two - research organization and the position</h4>
                        <p>
                            Learn as much about the organization and position you are applying for before the interview.
                            Visit the organization's website.  Analyze the job description and try to match your
                            experiences, interests, and abilities to the requirements for the position.  Visit Texas
                            State Career Services' website at www.careerservicestxstate.edu and investigate links
                            related to your particular occupational field.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Step 3 - Know yourself</h4>
                        <p>
                            Prepare to discuss your strengths, weaknesses, education, work experiences, personal goals,
                            and values.  Read the job description thoroughly, anticipating questions that focus on your
                            qualifications, the organization, and how the two fit together.  Question you may be asked
                            include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tell me about yourself</li>
                            <li>What are your goals?</li>
                            <li>Why do you want to work for this organization?</li>

                            Many other questions are outlines in the interview section of the Career Services Library.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The questions you ask will reveal much about your level of interest in the organization and
                            your level of preparation for the interview.  Ask questions that demonstrate a genuine
                            interest in and knowledge of teh organization and position.  Although each situation will
                            warrant specific inquiries, some suggested questions include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What characteristics do you look for in a successful employee?</li>
                            <li>What are a few of the problems I will be expected to solve?</li>
                            <li>What is the traditional career path for this position, and in what ways do you evaluate
                            employees?</li>
                            <li>If I may ask, what is your timetable for filling this current position?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Step 5 - Follow up</h4>
                        <p>
                            Write a brief letter of thanks for the interview.  In the letter you need to reiterate your
                            interest in the position and briefly state why you are the best candidate.  If you do not
                            hear from anyone in a week, then call to express your continued interest in the position.

                            How you will be assessed in a phone interview differs from how you might be assesses during
                            an in-person interview.  Rather than making your first impression with body language and a
                            firm handshake, your first impression will be your initial greeting on the phone.  The
                            interviewer may ask him or herself the following question after the interview:<br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>Did you have an enthusiastic voice?</li>

                            <li>Did you research the organization weill, or did you ask simple questions?</li>
                            <li>Did you express interest in a second interview?</li>
                            <li>Did you follow up with a thank you letter?</li>
                            <li>Did you pursue this opportunity with a phone call or e-mail?</li>
                            <li>did you send supporting material (resume, portfolio, etc)?</li>

                        <p>
                            The most common type of questions are behavioral.  These questions aim to determine how you
                            would operate on the job.  One strategy for answering behavior-based questions is to use the
                            <strong>STAR</strong> formula (<strong>S</strong>ituation, <strong>T</strong>ask,
                            <strong>A</strong>ction, <strong>R</strong>esponse). The formula ensures that you deliver a
                            complete and concise answer. For example:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Question</strong><br />
                            <i> Describe a time when you were a team member and someone fell behind.</i><br />
                            <strong>Answer</strong><br />
                            <strong>Situation</strong><i> I had been assigned to a team to build a canooe out of
                            concrete. One of our team members was not showing up for our lab sessions or doing his
                            assignments.</i><br />
                            <strong>Task</strong><i> To maintain a good relationship with him and to help him do the job,
                            I met with him in private.</i><br />
                            <strong>Action</strong><i> I explained to him the team's frustration and asked if there was
                            anything I could do to help. He told me was failing another class, so I found someone to
                            help him with that coursework.</i><br />
                            <strong>Result</strong><i> He was able to spend more time on our project and was also
                            grateful to me for helping him out.  we finished our project on time and received high
                            scores.</i>
                        </p>
                        <h4>Traditional Questions</h4>
                        <p> Traditional questions include questions that clarify points on your resume, evaluate your
                            accomplishments and goals, and assess your expectations of the organization. "Themes" also work
                            into these questions, as well as many opportunities for you to showcase your strengths. Some
                            traditional questions and themes include:</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Question</strong> Why do you want to work here?<br />
                            <strong>Theme</strong> Measure of knowledge of organization and interest in it.<br />
                            <strong>Question</strong> I have researched the leading organizations in this industry, and
                            yours seems to be the one that does the best job in terms of customer relations, encouraging
                            risk taking, and setting challenging goals. These qualities really appeal to me.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Difficult Questions</h4>
                        <p>Difficult questions are those that you are hoping they won't ask. For instance, if your
                            resume does not show continuous employment, you can expect to be asked to explain any gaps. In
                            order to answer these questions, you will need to come to terms with the issue at hand, see the
                            positive side of it, and demonstrate that you are eager to move on with your career
                        </p>

                            A phone interview may be all that is needed to convince your interviewer that you are the
                            right person for the job.  However, many organizations prefer to meet job seekers in person
                            before making any decisions. Consult with Career Services for help with face to face
                            interviews. we have many sources and can work with you during a taped practice interview to
                            assess your interviewing strengths and weaknesses.
